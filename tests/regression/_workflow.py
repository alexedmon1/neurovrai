"""Freeze a nipype workflow's *structure* as a golden — without running tools.

The boundary of a preprocessing refactor is often the workflow it assembles
(nodes, parameters, wiring), not the image output (which isn't bit-reproducible
across ANTs/FSL versions). That structure is deterministic and tool-free, so it
belongs in the fast blocking gate.
