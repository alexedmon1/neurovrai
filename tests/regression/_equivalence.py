"""Helpers for behavior-preservation (golden) regression tests.

The *boundary* of an implementation is a frozen contract:
    given a fixed input (``fixtures/``), a candidate implementation must
    reproduce a fixed output (``golden/``) within tolerance.

Any number of candidate implementations can be compared against the same
golden output to verify behavior is preserved across changes.

Updating golden outputs is deliberate and explicit:
    NEUROVRAI_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 uv run pytest -m regression
Only do this when you have *decided* the new behavior is correct, and commit
the changed golden files in their own reviewable commit.
